        Hi! My name is Cyra Moss. I am a 26 years old female developer based in
        Auckland, New Zealand. I am currently looking for work as a front end 
        developer. <br><br>
        
        When I was 16 I started a computer course. I loved the idea of making my own apps. 
        I finished level 3, 4 and 5 in business and computing courses pretty easily then I really had to 
        think about what I wanted to do. I started searching the internet and found alot of
        online courses like Udemy. I started doing courses to gain knowledge for as cheap 
        as I could as I had no money. I eventually came across SheCodes which I really 
        wanted to do so I saved enough to get it and loved the course! SheCodes is a coding
        bootcamp that helped me with HTML, CSS and JavaScript along with teaching me about
        bootstrap, APIs, hosting, SEO, responsive and more!

        <br><br>
        I can now confidently do front end development with what I have learnt from Udemy and
        SheCodes. After SheCodes I was interested in full stack and wanted to learn backend 
        too, so i started Mission Ready NZ's first Tech accelorator. Mission Ready taught me 
        things like cloud services, AI services, Architectural patterns, Agile mindset and practices,
        DevOps and automated deployment, design thinking and more! Mission Ready was great and I learnt alot! But I had a break for about 6 months to look 
        after my daughter and I am not as confident yet. I am still learning more every day.

        <br><br>
        I am making this portfolio to show potential employers some of my projects. So if you 
        would like to check out what I can do please click <a href="work.html">HERE</a>! and it would be great if you 
        could give me feedback by emailing me <a href="mailto:96cyra@gmail.com">HERE</a> as 
        i'm always looking for ways to be better.

          <h2>Personal</h2>
          <p>Hey so I am a 26 years old female who loves to learn new things and spend time with family. 
            I have a partner I've been with for 7 years now, as we are a same sex couple we had
            to find a sperm donor to start a family and after years of searching and trying we now
            have a beautiful baby girl who is 1 year old soon. <br><br> My daughter is one of the reasons I am
            really pushing myself to be the best Software Developer I can. I want to show her that being on 
             the benefit your whole life is not cool! And if you really want to do something you can.
